1. While Debugging... 

    Can't find a source file at "/cygdrive/d/YooKiseong/cppWorkspace/reviewC/src/reviewC.c" 
    Locate the file or edit the source lookup path to include its location.

My thanks to Christian for the answer. Here's the procedure to get things 
working ...


If you're working under Windows, have you set the required mappings?
Maybe Eclipse couldn't find the Source because of the missing mapping to
the (cygwin-)drive where your projects/workspaces are.

When you start Cygwin, enter "mount" and look for the mapping you have:
They may look like this:


Admin@bs11-01xp ~
$ mount
D:\cygwin\bin on /usr/bin type system (binmode)
D:\cygwin\lib on /usr/lib type system (binmode)
D:\cygwin on / type system (binmode)
c: on /cygdrive/c type system (binmode,noumount)
d: on /cygdrive/d type system (binmode,noumount)
e: on /cygdrive/e type system (binmode,noumount)
j: on /cygdrive/j type system (binmode,noumount)
n: on /cygdrive/n type system (binmode,noumount)
u: on /cygdrive/u type system (binmode,noumount)
w: on /cygdrive/w type system (binmode,noumount)
x: on /cygdrive/x type system (binmode,noumount)
y: on /cygdrive/y type system (binmode,noumount)
z: on /cygdrive/z type system (binmode,noumount)



My Projects ara all under J:\Projects, so my mapping needs to be present
in Eclipse as:
/cygdrive/j j:/


Open Eclipse and then click
- Windows => Preferences... => C/C++ => Debug =>Common Source Lookup
Path
- Add a new Path Mapping: click [Add] => Path Mapping => [OK]
- Select the new Mapping => [Edith] => change Name of Mapping "Project
Source" => [Add]
- set "Compilation path" to the Source (Sample cygwin!) "/cygdrive/j"
(without the quotes!)
- set"Local file system path" tho "J:\" (without the quotes!)

Now you are ready ti give it another try.... good luck !
